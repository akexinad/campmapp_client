# CAMPMAPP


## What Is It?

An app for outdoor lovers where you can locate and add campsites. It provides amenity info, photos as well as comments so you have updates on the condition of the site or whether or not the site has vacancies/is being renovated/permanently closed etc.

## Tech used

### Main Tech Stack
- React.js
- Ruby on Rails [API backend]

### Additional Ruby Gems
- Knock
- Cloudinary
- Cors

### npm packages
- React-Spring
- Axios
- React-Goole-Map

### API's
- Google Maps Javascript API

## Current Status

To be completed. Things I would like to add are:

- Comments
- Photo uploading
- Maps that render amenity specific campsites [e.g. render only the campsites that have a bbq]

## Things That I Would Change

### __BACKEND__
I'm going to redo this using either:
- Web sockets
- An API-only rails backend
- Firebase.

### __FRONTEND__
- Use hooks.js or make a version using Vue.js
